        <h1>Who is this Dzaster guy anyway</h1>
        <p>Dzaster is a finnish-english chap who makes english youtube videos (he does have a finnish channel but we don't talk about that) and likes to code but isn't that good at it (but much better than the avarage person).
        </p>
        <h1>Why does he have a website, I just checked, he has like 20 subs.</h1>
        <p>Dzaster is someone who believes he is cleverer than everyone else because he knows how to code. So to make him look even more cleverer he made himself a website</p>
